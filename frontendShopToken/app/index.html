      <h1> Shop </h1>
      <p> Over the course of the nexttwo years, we will develop Shop, a DApp for buying and selling goods in a decentralized manner. 
        All transactions will take place using shop tokens, so to buy things from Shop, one must own shop tokens. 
        Anyone can become a buyer or seller in this DApp. This will dIsRupT tHe oNlInE sHopPinG iNduStrY.

      <h2>Shop ICO </h2>
      <p> The best way to get shop tokens is by buying them right now from the ICO while the price is low. 
        The fund raised here will be used to <s> make me rich </s> fund the development of Shop. 
        The deadline for the ICO is 14th October 2018. If the minimum funding goal of 300 Ether is not raised by then, 
        you can get a refund from here. Otherwise, it will be withdrawn by the team to develop the DApp. 
        The maximum funding is 500 Ether. One Shop Token costs 0.01 Ether.
